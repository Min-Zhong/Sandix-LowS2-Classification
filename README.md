# Sandix-LowS2-Classification

This project contains the code of using BDT to classify the Low E S2 signal and S1 signal (data collected by Sandix detector).

WaveForm Simulation is used for training sample generation, and Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) is used to build the model and perform the classification.
